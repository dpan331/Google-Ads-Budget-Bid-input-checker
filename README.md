# Google-Ads-Budget-Bid-input-checker
In this repository I deal with the common problem all marketers face when monitoring a Google Ads ad account, one of the (many) mistakes that can happen due to the human factor. Wouldn't it be great to be able to run daily a short code that checks if all budgets and bids seem "logical"? By logical I mean there has not occured any mistyping, any additional zeros in the budget or/and any wrong comma position in the bids.

A short JavaScript Google Ads script can easily help you check all values that a user has input as budget or bid and inform you if a mistake has been made. You can deploy this code in your Google Ads UI by signing in your ad account and navigating to Tools & Settings > Bulk actions > Scripts. Once you insert your script and save it, you can also schedule it to run daily.
